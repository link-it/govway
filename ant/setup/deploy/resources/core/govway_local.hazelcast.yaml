hazelcast:

  # File utilizzabile ridefinire il 'clusterId'  e la 'network' su tutte le istanze di GovWay, senza dove agire sul singole file hazelcast.yaml (es. govway.hazelcast-atomic-long-counters.yaml, govway.hazelcast-pn-counters.yaml ...)
  # Se la proprietà 'org.openspcoop2.pdd.controlloTraffico.gestorePolicy.inMemory.HAZELCAST.sharedConfig' in govway_local.properties risulta indirizzare questo file,
  # a tutte le istanze di hazelcast verrà applicata la configurazione di rete di seguito.

  # You can create clusters using the cluster-name configuration element.
  # See: https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/clusters/creating-clusters
  #
  # Se definita sovrascrive il valore indicato nella proprietà 'org.openspcoop2.pdd.controlloTraffico.gestorePolicy.inMemory.HAZELCAST.group_id' in govway_local.properties
  #cluster-name: govway
  
  # Per una documentazione degli elementi si consiglia di consultare la documentazione di Hazelcast: https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/clusters/network-configuration
  # La documentazione sotto riportata è stata estratta dalla documentazione 'network-configuration' sopra indicata.
  network:
    
    # overrides the public address of a member.
    #
    #public-address: 11.22.33.44:5555

    #By default, Hazelcast lets the system pick up an ephemeral port during socket bind operation. 
    #But security policies/firewalls may require you to restrict outbound ports to be used by Hazelcast-enabled applications. To fulfill this requirement, you can configure Hazelcast to use only defined outbound ports. 
    #
    #outbound-ports:
    #  - 38000,38500-38600

    #When you shutdown a cluster member, the server socket port goes into the TIME_WAIT state for the next couple of minutes. 
    #If you start the member right after shutting it down, you may not be able to bind it to the same port because it is in the TIME_WAIT state. 
    #If you set the reuse-address element to true, the TIME_WAIT state is ignored and you can bind the member to the same port again.
    #
    #reuse-address: true

    # you can specify the ports that Hazelcast uses to communicate between cluster members.
    # !! NOTA !!: non definire l'elemento 'port'.
    # Anche se definito verrà ignorato poichè ogni singola configurazione utilizzata in GovWay richiede una porta dedicata.
    # Per modificarla si deve agire nel file govway.hazelcast-*.yaml presente all'interno dell'archivio govway.ear, 
    # modificandolo direttamente dentro l'archivio o riportandolo nella directory di configurazione esterna.
    #
    #port:
    #  auto-increment: false
    #  port: 5701
    #  ....

    join:

      # By default, Hazelcast tries to automatically detect a member’s runtime environment and apply rules to help members discover each other in those environments.
      # !!! NOTE !!! Auto Detection is not recommended for production. See: https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/clusters/discovery-mechanisms

        enabled: true

      # The multicast element includes parameters to fine tune the multicast join mechanism.

      # The tcp-ip element includes parameters to fine tune the TCP/IP join mechanism: https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/clusters/network-configuration#tcp-ip-element
      #enabled: Specifies whether the TCP/IP discovery is enabled or not. Values can be true or false.
      #required-member: IP address of the required member. Cluster is only formed if the member with this IP address is found.
      #member: IP address(es) of one or more well known members. Once members are connected to these well known ones, all member addresses are communicated with each other. 
      #        You can also give comma separated IP addresses using the members element.
      #        ! NOTE ! tcp-ip element also accepts the interface parameter. See the Interfaces element description: https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/clusters/network-configuration#interfaces
      # connection-timeout-seconds: Defines the connection timeout in seconds. This is the maximum amount of time Hazelcast is going to try to connect to a well known member before giving up. 
      #                             Setting it to a too low value could mean that a member is not able to connect to a cluster. 
      #                             Setting it to a too high value means that member startup could slow down because of longer timeouts, for example when a well known member is not up. 
      #                             Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IPs listed and the members cannot properly build up the cluster. Its default value is 5 seconds.
      #
      # NOTA: la keyword 'GOVWAY_INSTANCE_PORT' verrà sostituita con la porta dedicata all'istanza che viene attivata
      #       Se non viene indicata una porta, verrà aggiunta automaticamente al momento dell'istanziazione della configurazione.
