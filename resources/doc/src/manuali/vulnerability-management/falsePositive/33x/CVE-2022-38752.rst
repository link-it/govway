Libreria: org.yaml:snakeyaml 1.33

**Descrizione**

- CVE-2022-38752: Using snakeYAML to parse untrusted YAML files may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by stack-overflow.

- CVE-2022-41854: Those using Snakeyaml to parse untrusted YAML files may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by stack overflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.

- CVE-2022-1471: SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization.

- CVE-2022-3064: Parsing malicious or large YAML documents can consume excessive amounts of CPU or memory.

- CVE-2021-4235: Due to unbounded alias chasing, a maliciously crafted YAML file can cause the system to consume significant system resources. If parsing user input, this may be used as a denial of service vector.


**Falso Positivo per GovWay**

Le vulnerabilità non sono sfruttabili su GovWay per effettuare attacchi poichè la libreria viene utilizzata solamente per la gestione delle interfacce yaml caricate sulla console dagli amministratori e non viene utilizzata per input forniti dinamicamente nelle richieste gestite dai componenti di runtime.
