**Descrizione**

Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. 

An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. 

When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crashes. 

This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.115.
